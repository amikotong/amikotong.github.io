            <strong>Problem:</strong>
            In this project, I was responsible for initially building the platform's user interface and the first design system. This involved communication, discussion, design, and presenting prototypes, as well as coordinating with developers. The developers requested a design system that could be quickly assembled, with interface blocks that could be reused or reassembled, similar to building a burger at McDonald's.

            From our discussions, I understood that they needed an MVP version for trial runs. To expedite development, they required reusable UI components (a design system).

            The client expected a user interface that would appeal to North American users, with a simple and clean aesthetic. They required the design and prototyping to be completed within two months.

            I faced two challenges:

            Tight deadlines.
            The client proposed some innovative features for which I had few examples to reference.</p>

        <p>Design Process:
            To facilitate clearer communication and ensure the completeness of the website structure, I led the team in discussing and constructing a sitemap. Through this process, I gained insight into the team's needs, brand direction, and their definition of similar products.

            After organizing the sitemap, we realized that the website had too much content to complete all at once. I suggested minimizing the workload and focusing on the main functionalities first. Despite this, we still found the workload daunting. After discussion, we decided to prioritize tasks and complete them in stages. We focused on simpler and less ambiguous features first (such as landing pages, shops, auctions, trades, etc.).

            To ensure smooth and rapid design completion, I established an effective collaboration routine with the team: discussing the sitemap, confirming wireframes, and presenting prototypes.

        <p>My workflow:

            Based on the sitemap, I created wireframes and further refined details with the team, updating and adjusting the sitemap as needed.
            I began establishing the UI style, referencing Material UI data to ensure the UI met market standards.
            I started building the UI design system to ensure consistency in UI for the same functionalities.
            I shared progress, presenting my design timeline to the team at appropriate intervals to keep them informed of the project's progress.
            Finally, I connected each section (such as landing pages, shops, auctions, trades, etc.), thoroughly discussing them with the team to identify any issues and make final adjustments.
            After confirmation with the team, the developers began development. During this process, they would ask me questions, and we would communicate to clarify any ambiguities in the design.</p>

        <p>Lessons Learned:

            When communicating with clients, as a designer, I should find suitable times to gradually unfold ideas from an easily understandable perspective rather than presenting complex ideas directly, which can make it difficult for others to understand my intentions.
            Keep communication concise and focus on key points. Too much information can confuse the team, especially non-design professionals. Sometimes, simple and direct expression is easier for others to understand. Also, when others express themselves, I should pay attention to details, listen more, and offer new insights to better understand client needs.
            I gained an understanding of the perspective and limitations of a designer. The team considers factors such as business, funding, development, capabilities, and time. Therefore, I should not have a strong design bias but rather discover and understand client requirements and communications from details, and ultimately implement my solutions into design. Using a combination of visual and verbal presentation facilitates clearer communication with clients.</p>

        <p>Client Feedback: "Patient, smart, and professional." Very patient, able to quickly understand their intentions. The design solutions provided met their requirements and expectations.

        <p>Other:
            During the project, I document what I've learned, areas for improvement, and things to try in the next phase. This helps me reflect on the details of the work process, aiding in adapting quickly to the team and my growth as a designer.</p>
